/**
 * The View half of the blacklist: collapse the chat row whose text carries [Blacklist.Marker].
 *
 * Driven from the existing framework hook on TextView.setText (see [EmoteHooks]), which is both
 * obfuscation-immune and exactly the right moment: RecyclerView binds a row BEFORE measuring it,
 * so a height written here is honoured in the same layout pass and the hidden message never gets
 * a frame on screen.
 *
 * Three things about this are deliberate and were each arrived at the hard way:
 *
 *  - ONE level up, never a walk. `chat_message_item` is the message TextView inside
 *    `chat_message_container` in the two layouts we cover, but it is also the ROOT of
 *    system_message_item, deleted_mod_notice and auto_mod_caught_notice. On those a walk looking
 *    for a container would find none, climb past the RecyclerView and reach a fragment or activity
 *    root — the same mistake that once hid the whole Home tab and produced a 404 ghost page.
 *
 *  - INVISIBLE, never GONE. A RecyclerView LayoutManager has no visibility check, so a GONE row is
 *    still measured at full height and still consumes it — `layoutParams.height = 0` is the entire
 *    mechanism, and the visibility is only there to stop the row drawing. GONE would also break the
 *    restore, because ViewRootImpl discards layout requests from a view that is GONE.
 *
 *  - The One Chat overlay is NOT handled. Its `one_chat_message_container` id is carried by a
 *    fragment root in vertical theatre, so collapsing it would take the whole surface with it.
 *
 * Every write is gated on the state actually changing. Mutating a view during a layout pass
 * schedules another one, so an ungated write spins forever.
