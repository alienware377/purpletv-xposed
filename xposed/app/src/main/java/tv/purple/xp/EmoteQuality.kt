/**
 * Emote image quality (settings key `emote_quality`).
 *
 * Every third-party CDN exposes the same emote at several resolutions, but each spells the size
 * differently, so the level is mapped per provider here rather than scattered through [EmoteRepo].
 * Lower quality means smaller downloads and less decode work — worth having on slow devices, since
 * a busy chat can decode dozens of animated emotes per second.
 *
 * The level only affects URLs built AFTER it changes, so [EmoteRepo.refetch] re-runs the loaders
 * when the user picks a new value.
