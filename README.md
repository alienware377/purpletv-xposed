# PurpleTV ReVive — Continuation of the great work

**An Xposed / LSPosed module that brings third-party emotes, badges, pronouns and a pile of chat quality-of-life tweaks to the official Twitch app for Android.**

If you have ever wanted BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ and 7TV emotes to actually render in Twitch mobile chat instead of showing up as plain text, this module does that — without replacing the Twitch app and without touching your login.

## What this module will never do

**There is no ad blocking, and there are no money-related mods of any kind.** That is a deliberate design decision, not a missing feature — and pull requests adding either will be declined.

- **No ad blocking.** Ads are how Twitch and the streamers on it get paid.
- **No Bits, subscription, Turbo or payment workarounds.** Nothing here touches money, anywhere.
- **No view-botting, auto-chatting, or faked engagement.**

We fully support Twitch and the people who make a living on it. This module is about the *chat reading* experience — emotes, badges, and readability — and it is not interested in taking anything away from the platform or from creators.

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **7TV emotes** | Global and per-channel 7TV emotes render inline in chat, including animated WEBP. |
| **BetterTTV (BTTV) emotes** | Global and channel BTTV emotes, animated GIF support. |
| **FrankerFaceZ (FFZ) emotes** | Global and channel FFZ emote sets. |
| **Emote autocomplete** | Start typing an emote name — no leading colon required — and pick it from an inline suggestion strip. |
| **Favorites bar** | Pin your most-used Twitch and subscriber emotes to a bar inside the native emote picker. Persists across channels and restarts. |
| **Auto-claim channel points** | Bonus chests are claimed automatically in the background, whether or not the chest is on screen. |
| **Third-party badges** | FFZ, Chatterino, DankChat and Chatsen badges shown next to usernames. |
| **Pronouns** | Pronoun tags from pronouns.alejo.io shown next to usernames. |
| **Timestamps** | Nine timestamp formats, including seconds, which Twitch itself cannot show. |
| **Deleted messages** | Show what a deleted message actually said, struck through, greyed, or plain. Works as an ordinary viewer, not only as a moderator. |
| **Highlighter** | Tint a whole chat row when it contains a word, or comes from a given user. Separate colour for `@mentions` of you. |
| **Blacklist** | Hide matching chat messages completely, with no gap left behind. |
| **`/me` styling** | Italic, coloured, or both. |
| **Chat appearance** | Font size, alternating row backgrounds, landscape chat width and opacity. |
| **Home tab tidy-up** | Remove the Live and Clips tabs to land on Following, and hide the Browse tab. |

Everything is opt-in and individually toggleable — and the whole module can be switched off in one tap, see [Turning it off](#turning-it-off).

## Screenshots

<!-- Add screenshots to docs/ and reference them here -->

## Requirements

- Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer
- A rooted device with **[LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed)**, **or** a non-rooted device using **[LSPatch](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPatch)**
- The official Twitch app installed

## Installation

### Rooted — LSPosed

1. Download `purpletv-xp.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/alienware377/purpletv-revive/releases/latest).
2. Install it like a normal app.
3. Open LSPosed → **Modules** → enable **PurpleTV XP**.
4. In the module's scope list, tick **Twitch**.
5. Force-stop and reopen Twitch.

### Non-rooted — LSPatch

1. Download `purpletv-xp.apk` from the [latest release](https://github.com/alienware377/purpletv-revive/releases/latest).
2. In LSPatch, select your installed Twitch app, choose **Integrated** patch mode, and add `purpletv-xp.apk` as an embedded module.
3. Install the patched Twitch APK that LSPatch produces.

> Your Twitch login is preserved across reinstalls as long as the signing key stays the same.

## Usage

Open Twitch and start watching any channel. Third-party emotes load automatically for that channel.

- **Emote autocomplete** — just start typing an emote name in the chat box.
- **Add a favorite** — long-press any Twitch or subscriber emote in the native emote picker.
- **Remove a favorite** — long-press it in the favorites bar.
- **Settings** — open Twitch's own **Settings** screen; **PurpleTV** is the first row.

## Turning it off

The first row of the PurpleTV settings screen is **PurpleTV enabled**. Turn it off and restart the Twitch app, and you get the stock Twitch app back — no hooks are installed at all.

The settings row itself stays put while the module is switched off, showing just that one switch, so you can always turn it back on. Your other settings are remembered while it is off. **A restart of the Twitch app is required either way**, because the module installs its hooks once, when the app starts.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alienware377/purpletv-revive.git
cd purpletv-revive/xposed
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

The unsigned APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Sign it with any key before installing.

## How it works

The Twitch Android app is obfuscated with R8, and class and method names change on every release — which is why most Twitch mods break within weeks of an update. This module deliberately avoids naming obfuscated classes. Instead it anchors on things R8 cannot rename:

- **Android framework classes** (`Activity`, `EditText`, `ViewGroup`) hooked directly.
- **Resource entry names** (`getResourceEntryName`) — resource IDs survive obfuscation and are package-independent.
- **Kept public model packages** such as `tv.twitch.android.shared.chat.pub.messages.data`, which R8 preserves.
- **Twitch's own GraphQL gateway** for channel points, rather than the UI layer.

The result is a module that keeps working across Twitch updates far longer than smali-patch-based mods.

## Compatibility

Tested against recent Twitch Android releases. Because the module avoids obfuscated identifiers, it generally survives app updates. If a feature stops working after a Twitch update, please [open an issue](https://github.com/alienware377/purpletv-revive/issues) with your Twitch version number.

## FAQ

**Does this get my account banned?**
The module reads third-party emote APIs and uses Twitch's own GraphQL endpoints with your existing session. It does not automate chat messages or viewing. That said, any client modification is against Twitch's Terms of Service — use it at your own risk.

**Does it block ads?**
No, and it never will. See [What this module will never do](#what-this-module-will-never-do). Ads pay Twitch and the streamers; blocking them takes money out of creators' pockets.

**Does it unlock subs, Bits, Turbo or anything paid?**
No. There are no money-related mods of any kind, deliberately.

**How do I get the normal Twitch app back?**
Turn off **PurpleTV enabled** at the top of the module's settings and restart Twitch. See [Turning it off](#turning-it-off).

**Does it work without root?**
Yes, via LSPatch. See [Installation](#installation).

**Why do some favorites show as text instead of an image?**
The emote image is cached per channel. Favorites from a channel you are not currently watching fall back to their name until the image is fetched.
